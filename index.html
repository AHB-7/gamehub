        <h2>Web Security</h2>
        <p id="web-security-question">
            As a front-end developer, I can secure the website in various ways.
            One way to protect my clients is the Sanitization of data that the
            clients provide. By doing so I will secure that no now will be able
            to provide any unwanted URLs that can request another client's
            information. Another thing a front-end developer can do is to secure
            authorization and authentication which will allow clients for more
            secure access to their one product. Nevertheless, the clients need
            to have a well-functional app or a website so it is important to
            deliver Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration (CI/CD). In
            this way, many issues in the code and the security will be checked
            frequently. Last and not least it is important to ensure the
            security of the hosting platform of the website, and ensure that the
            API consuming has put implementation of automatic user timeout
            consideration.
